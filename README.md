# wahooDeviceThemes
wahooDeviceThemes is a collection of device themes for your Wahoo device. Device themes are used to adjust how maps are rendered on your Wahoo device.

You certainly came here after you have created custom, up-to-date maps with [wahooMapsCreator](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator#readme).

> why? After you generated custom maps with addons like POIs, contour lines, ... or simlpy with the up-to-date maps, you want to take the next step and display these OSM elements on your Wahoo device or change their appearance

## Overview of themes
For each rendering type (Mapsforge and VTM) there is a separate folder for the themes. VTM themes might be more important/ used because more devices can use it and it has more features. Find the documentation about device themes [here](https://github.com/treee111/wahooMapsCreator/blob/develop/docs/TAGS_ON_MAP_AND_DEVICE.md#device-theme).

These are the themes covered in this repo:
